 * @brief   Public API for interacting with Neuroon Core signal stream
 *          processing algorithms.
 *
 * This file provides the definitions of all the data structures
 * and functions required to use signal processing algorithms of Neuroon,
 * i.e. sleep staging, brain-wave levels calculation.
 *
 * Specifically it defines the functions to initialize stream processing, change
 * its state, provide the callbacks for receiving the results of
 * the computations etc.
 *
 * The contents of this file are a part of API to the Neuroon-Core library.
