 *  @brief   Public API for standalone Neuroon algorithms.
 *
 *  This file provides the definitions of all the data structures
 *  and functions required to use the algorithms:
 *  - cross-over point computation
 *  - perfect napping schedule
 *  - jetlag therapy algorithms
 *  Specifically it defines the functions to initialize stream processing,
 * change
 *  its state, provide the callbacks for receiving the results of
 *  the computations etc.
 *
 *  The contents of this file are a part of API to the Neuroon-Core library.
